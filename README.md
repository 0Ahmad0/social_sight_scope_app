# Social Sight Scope

Social Sight Scope is an innovative Flutter application designed to assist individuals, including those with Alzheimer's disease, in recognizing faces, storing information, and translating languages. Through facial recognition and real-time language translation, the app simplifies social interactions and improves the quality of life for users facing memory impairments or communication barriers.

## Problem Domain

- **Underutilized AR for Alzheimer’s**: AR technology has untapped potential in helping Alzheimer’s patients with social interactions.
- **Memory Impairment**: People with memory issues struggle to recognize and connect with others.
- **Current Solution Gaps**: There is a lack of applications offering real-time facial recognition, language translation, and emotion analysis.
- **Need for Tailored Solutions**: AR apps designed for these challenges can significantly enhance social well-being.

## Key Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Uses AI to identify and provide information about people the user interacts with.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Facilitates communication by translating different languages instantly.
- **Information Storage**: Safely stores user data to assist with recognizing faces and contextual information in future interactions.
- **Emotion Analysis (Future Update)**: Provides emotional context to help users better understand social cues.
